rsclib: Utility Routines
========================

The library includes various utility modules used in other projects.

 - Autosuper magic (originally from Guido van Rossums announcement of
   Python 2.2): For refactoring it's a good idea that each class knows
   its parents, achieved by adding a the __super attribute. Use as,
   e.g., self.__super.method for calling method in the parent.
 - Config_File for python-syntax configuration files used in several of
   my projects.
 - Firstname: given a string-candidate of a first name, check with
   popular web-site if it is really considered a first name. 
 - grepmime: search for pattern in email attachments (even if these are
   encoded)
 - HTML_Parse for opening and parsing URLs
 - IP4_Address: IP v4 Addresses with subnet masking
 - Math implements Euclids algorithm for greatest common divisor and as
   a by-product the least common multiple
 - PDF_Parse for opening and parsing PDFs, needs pdftotext installed
 - PM_Value: Possibly missing value, encapsulate a number which may be
   missing and associated arithmetics.
 - Rational: Implementation of Rational numbers
 - stateparser: Simple state-machine parser class
 - Tex_CSV_Writer: Write CVS files in a syntax that can be parsed by
   TeX. Implements same interface as the csv module. Only implements
   writing.
 - ast_call: A simple call manager using asterisk: This can be used to
   originate a call and log all event associated to that call. So you
   can find out the status of the call and optionally the dialstatus.
 - bero: A configurator for the `bero*fos`_ failover switch. See my
   `blogpost`_ why I wrote that (short summary: to work around bugs in
   the firmware of the device which are not addressed by the
   configurator code that comes with the device).
 - PDF_Signature: experimental code for checking signatures on adobe PDF
   documents
 - iter_recipes: magic with iterators

Download the source at https://sourceforge.net/projects/rsclib/
and install using the standard python setup, e.g.::

 python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local


Changes
-------

Version 0.11: Not announced on freshmeat

Add a parser for CDR records in asterisk. We currently use text-files
only, this might be later extended for database use. Some fixes for
ast_call, make call-handling more robust (some race conditions would
identify events of other calls as belonging to our initiated call).
Add an execute module for executing commands and handling IO, this also
has a Lock and a Log mixin.

 - add ast_cdr.py
 - fix ast_call.py
 - fix up-chaining in stateparser.py
 - add execute.py

Version 0.10: Not announced on freshmeat

add ast_call for asterisk auto-dialling, small fixes to IP4_Address, add
bero*fos configurator, experimental code for checking PDF signature

 - add ast_call.py
 - Firstname: don't look up names with len < 2
 - IP4_Address: some aliases for common functions
 - IP4_Address: add __cmp__
 - bero.py: bero*fos configurator
 - HTML_Parse updated for python 2.5
 - stateparser update: use self.matrix by default
 - PDF_Signature: experimental code for checking signatures on adobe PDF
   documents
 - iter_recipes: some magic with iterators

Version 0.9: Not announced on freshmeat

Add binom to the Math package, add Firstname, Bug-Fix Release Rational

 - binom (n, m) computes the binomial coefficient of n, m.
 - Firstname: check if candidate is a first name candidate according to
   popular web site.
 - Rational: On division we could get a negative denominator -- fixed
 - make Config_File a descendent of autosuper

Version 0.8: Not announced on freshmeat

Added more documentation.
State-machine parser stateparser implemented. Rational number arithmetic
package added.

 - stateparser implemented (simple state-machine line-oriented
   configurable parser)
 - usage-example of IP4_Address prints debian /etc/network/interfaces
   entry.
 - Math added (Euclids algorithm, gcd, lcm)
 - Rational number arithmetics
 - cookie processing for HTML_Parse
 - basic HTML auth for HTML_Parse
 - HTML_Parse: move to urllib2

Version 0.7: Not announced on freshmeat

Small Python library with various things such as Configuration file
parsing (in Python syntax), HTML and PDF parsing.

 - First Release version
