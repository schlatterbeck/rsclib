rsclib: Utility Routines
========================

The library includes various utility modules used in other projects.

 - ast_call: A simple call manager using asterisk: This can be used to
   originate a call and log all event associated to that call. So you
   can find out the status of the call and optionally the dialstatus.
 - ast_cdr: parser for CDR records in asterisk. We currently use
   text-files only, this might be later extended for database use.
 - Autosuper magic (originally from Guido van Rossums announcement of
   Python 2.2): For refactoring it's a good idea that each class knows
   its parents (that the parent is not hardcoded in the upcall),
   achieved by adding a the __super attribute. Use as, e.g.,
   self.__super.method for calling method in the parent.
 - bero: A configurator for the `bero*fos`_ failover switch. See my
   `blogpost`_ why I wrote that (short summary: to work around bugs in
   the firmware of the device which are not addressed by the
   configurator code that comes with the device).
 - Config_File for python-syntax configuration files used in several of
   my projects.
 - execute: module for executing commands and handling IO, this also
   has a Lock and a Log mixin. Now there is also a framework for
   executing processes in a pipeline, there can be fork-points in the
   pipeline where the output of one process feeds several pipelines.
   See test_exec.py and test2_exec.py.
 - Firstname: given a string-candidate of a first name, check with
   popular web-site if it is really considered a first name. 
 - grepmime: search for pattern in email attachments (even if these are
   encoded)
 - HTML_Parse for opening and parsing URLs
 - IP4_Address: IP v4 Addresses with subnet masking
 - iter_recipes: magic with iterators
 - lcr: model the status of Linux Call Router ISDN lines.
 - Math implements Euclids algorithm for greatest common divisor and as
   a by-product the least common multiple
 - nmap: A parser for output of nmap scans to (e.g. to generate tables
   in TeX)
 - ocf: small framework for writing OCF scripts for the heartbeat
   cluster resource manager (probably also usable for the newer version
   called pacemaker but for now only tested with the version in Debian
   stable aka lenny).
 - PDF_Parse for opening and parsing PDFs, needs pdftotext installed
 - PDF_Signature: experimental code for checking signatures on adobe PDF
   documents
 - PM_Value: Possibly missing value, encapsulate a number which may be
   missing and associated arithmetics.
 - Rational: Implementation of Rational numbers
 - stateparser: Simple state-machine parser class
 - timeout: A simple timeout mechanism using SIGALRM
 - Tex_CSV_Writer: Write CVS files in a syntax that can be parsed by
   TeX. Implements same interface as the csv module. Only implements
   writing.
 - trafficshape: Simple traffic shaping configuration: Currently
   generates Linux tc commands for a traffic shaping config using hfsc
   for shaping and sfq or red for the leaf qdiscs.

Resources
---------

Download the source at https://sourceforge.net/projects/rsclib/
and install using the standard python setup, e.g.::

 python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local


Changes
-------

Version 0.15: Not announced on freshmeat

Add a framework for traffic shaping with linux iproute (tc). Minor
updates to iter_recipes.

 - Initial implementation of trafficshape.py
 - Add iter_recipes.combinations from python2.6 manpage of itertools
   for backward compatibility

Version 0.14: Not announced on freshmeat

Add a framework for process pipeline execution, processes can either be
python methods or external programs (with parameter list).  They can be
connected in a pipe and there may be T-points in the pipe, where the
pipe forks into two or more pipelines fed by the output of one process.

 - Add process pipeline framework
 - HTML_Parse now has an explicit translate hook for preprocessing the
   html page before parsing it. This defaults to the old behaviour of
   filtering out common characters in broken HTML.
 - Add nmap parser (e.g. to generate TeX tables from an nmap scan)
 - Fix Lock_Mixin in execute module to remove lockfile at exit,
   this used to rely on __del__ which breaks in certain cases.
 - add file upload to HTML_Parse

Version 0.13: Not announced on freshmeat

Bug-Fix Release: Fix signal handler in timeout.py

 - fix signal handler timeout.py

Version 0.12: Not announced on freshmeat

Add a simple timeout mechanism using SIGALRM.

 - add timeout.py

Version 0.11: Not announced on freshmeat

Add a parser for CDR records in asterisk. We currently use text-files
only, this might be later extended for database use. Some fixes for
ast_call, make call-handling more robust (some race conditions would
identify events of other calls as belonging to our initiated call).
Add an execute module for executing commands and handling IO, this also
has a Lock and a Log mixin. Add ocf.py, a small framework for writing
OCF scripts for the heartbeat cluster resource manager (probably also
usable for the newer version called pacemaker but for now only tested
with the version in Debian stable aka lenny). Add lcr.py to model the
status of Linux Call Router ISDN lines.

 - add ast_cdr.py
 - fix ast_call.py
 - fix up-chaining in stateparser.py
 - add execute.py
 - add ocf.py
 - add lcr.py

Version 0.10: Not announced on freshmeat

add ast_call for asterisk auto-dialling, small fixes to IP4_Address, add
bero*fos configurator, experimental code for checking PDF signature

 - add ast_call.py
 - Firstname: don't look up names with len < 2
 - IP4_Address: some aliases for common functions
 - IP4_Address: add __cmp__
 - bero.py: bero*fos configurator
 - HTML_Parse updated for python 2.5
 - stateparser update: use self.matrix by default
 - PDF_Signature: experimental code for checking signatures on adobe PDF
   documents
 - iter_recipes: some magic with iterators

Version 0.9: Not announced on freshmeat

Add binom to the Math package, add Firstname, Bug-Fix Release Rational

 - binom (n, m) computes the binomial coefficient of n, m.
 - Firstname: check if candidate is a first name candidate according to
   popular web site.
 - Rational: On division we could get a negative denominator -- fixed
 - make Config_File a descendent of autosuper

Version 0.8: Not announced on freshmeat

Added more documentation.
State-machine parser stateparser implemented. Rational number arithmetic
package added.

 - stateparser implemented (simple state-machine line-oriented
   configurable parser)
 - usage-example of IP4_Address prints debian /etc/network/interfaces
   entry.
 - Math added (Euclids algorithm, gcd, lcm)
 - Rational number arithmetics
 - cookie processing for HTML_Parse
 - basic HTML auth for HTML_Parse
 - HTML_Parse: move to urllib2

Version 0.7: Not announced on freshmeat

Small Python library with various things such as Configuration file
parsing (in Python syntax), HTML and PDF parsing.

 - First Release version
