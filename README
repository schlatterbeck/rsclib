rsclib: Utility Routines
========================

The library includes various utility modules used in other projects.

 - Autosuper magic (originally from Guido van Rossums announcement of
   Python 2.2): For refactoring it's a good idea that each class knows
   its parents, achieved by adding a the __super attribute. Use as,
   e.g., self.__super.method for calling method in the parent.
 - Config_File for python-syntax configuration files used in several of
   my projects.
 - grepmime: search for pattern in email attachments (even if these are
   encoded)
 - HTML_Parse for opening and parsing URLs
 - IP4_Address: IP v4 Addresses with subnet masking
 - Math implements Euclids algorithm for greatest common divisor and as
   a by-product the least common multiple
 - PDF_Parse for opening and parsing PDFs, needs pdftotext installed
 - PM_Value: Possibly missing value, encapsulate a number which may be
   missing and associated arithmetics.
 - Rational: Implementation of Rational numbers
 - stateparser: Simple state-machine parser class
 - Tex_CSV_Writer: Write CVS files in a syntax that can be parsed by
   TeX. Implements same interface as the csv module. Only implements
   writing.

and install using the standard python setup, e.g.::

 python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local


Changes
-------

Version 0.9: Not announced on freshmeat

Add binom to the Math package.

 - binom (n, m) computes the binomial coefficient of n, m.

Version 0.8: Not announced on freshmeat

Added more documentation.
State-machine parser stateparser implemented. Rational number arithmetic
package added.

 - stateparser implemented (simple state-machine line-oriented
   configurable parser)
 - usage-example of IP4_Address prints debian /etc/network/interfaces
   entry.
 - Math added (Euclids algorithm, gcd, lcm)
 - Rational number arithmetics
 - cookie processing for HTML_Parse
 - basic HTML auth for HTML_Parse
 - HTML_Parse: move to urllib2

Version 0.7: Not announced on freshmeat

Small Python library with various things such as Configuration file
parsing (in Python syntax), HTML and PDF parsing.

 - First Release version
