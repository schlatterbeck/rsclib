rsclib: Utility Routines
========================

The library includes various utility modules used in other projects.

 - Autosuper magic (originally from Guido van Rossums announcement of
   Python 2.2): For refactoring it's a good idea that each class knows
   its parents, achieved by adding a the __super attribute. Use as,
   e.g., self.__super.method for calling method in the parent.
 - Config_File for python-syntax configuration files used in several of
   my projects.
 - HTML_Parse for opening and parsing URLs
 - PDF_Parse for opening and parsing PDFs, needs pdftotext installed
 - PM_Value: Possibly missing value, encapsulate a number which may be
   missing and associated arithmetics.
 - grepmime: search for pattern in email attachments (even if these are
   encoded)
 - Tex_CSV_Writer: Write CVS files in a syntax that can be parsed by
   TeX. Implements same interface as the csv module. Only implements
   writing.
